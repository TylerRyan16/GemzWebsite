                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello, my name is <span>Tyler Ryan</span>. I am a senior DNID major with a heavy focus on Game
                    Design.
                    The project I am showcasing today is <span>Gemz</span>.
                    Gemz is a factory-simulation game set in the far-future in an interplanetary environment. Players
                    mine and refine gems
                    on various planets while managing factory layouts and trading with alien factions to build a
                    thriving econonomy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gemz combines resource management, strategy, and exploration, where players expand factories,
                    automate processes,
                    and engage in ethical dilemmas related to resource exploitation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In Gemz, players experience mechanics inspired by games like Factorio and Shapez 2, focusing on
                    automation and
                    resource management while balancing planetary exploitation with economic growth.

                    <h2>Movement</h2>
                    <p>The player controls a flight-enabled camera that can maneuver freely in all directions—forward,
                        backward, left, right, up, and down. The movement system provides full 3D control, giving
                        players
                        the ability to explore the environment from any angle. Players can adjust the camera speed by
                        scrolling
                        the mouse wheel, allowing for fine-tuned control when navigating close spaces or zooming out for
                        a
                        broader view of their expanding factory. Speed can range between 5 and 50 units, depending on
                        the
                        player's preference, enabling both slow and precise movements, or fast traversal over large
                        areas.

                    <h2>Tile Placement</h2>
                    <p>Gemz operates on a tile-based grid system for factory construction and resource management.
                        Players
                        place tiles to build conveyor belts, mining stations, and other essential components of their
                        factory.
                        Each tile must align with the grid, ensuring a structured and organized layout. The snapping
                        system
                        allows for seamless placement, avoiding errors in positioning. Additionally, certain buildings
                        or
                        machines can only be placed after unlocking technologies, adding a layer of strategy to the
                        construction
                        process as players must balance resources and available space effectively.

                    <h2>Trade & Economy</h2>
                    <p>The trade and economy system is key to success in Gemz. Players establish trade routes with alien
                        factions across planets, negotiating resource deals. Prices fluctuate based on scarcity, supply,
                        and demand, requiring strategic planning to profit from market trends and avoid financial loss.
                        Strong faction relationships unlock rare materials and technologies, enhancing factory
                        production. Profits can be reinvested to expand factories or upgrade machinery for increased
                        efficiency.

                    <h2>Resource Management</h2>
                    <p>Players must manage the resources they mine and refine, while confronting ethical dilemmas tied
                        to resource exploitation. Extracting gems from planets involves refining and transportation
                        costs, with market fluctuations impacting profits. Over-mining risks depleting resources,
                        destabilizing ecosystems and alien factions.
                        <br>Players must choose between short-term gains or
                        sustainable methods, with their decisions affecting relationships with alien species and the
                        long-term stability of their interplanetary empire.

                    <p>Long ago, as Earth faced environmental collapse and dwindling resources, humanity embarked on a
                        bold mission to secure its survival. Led by the LEAP Foundation (League of Earth's Advancement
                        and Progress), they sought not just to escape Earth but to find a new world where humanity could
                        rebuild. After years of searching the stars, they finally discovered Astralis Prime, a vibrant
                        planet offering hope and a future for the human race.
                        <br><br>
                        Astralis Prime became humanity’s heart of expansion, but it wasn’t the only world they found.
                        During their journey, LEAP discovered Elyssia, a lush, resource-rich planet. With untouched
                        forests and valuable minerals, it quickly became key to humanity’s plans for survival and growth
                        in the galaxy.
                        <br><br>
                        However, settling Elyssia came with challenges. The planet’s wealth attracted alien
                        civilizations like the Neblitarians and Va'Kara, leading to complex diplomatic relationships.
                        Humanity now faces a struggle for control over Elyssia's resources, navigating between
                        cooperation and conflict with these factions.
